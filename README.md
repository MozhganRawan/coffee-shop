🚧 Challenges Faced in the Smart Coffee Assistant Project

1. 🧪 Validating User Inputs
Ensuring users entered valid values like age, coffee type, and quantity without crashing the program.

2. 🔐 Role-Based Login System
Implementing a login that accepts only "admin" or "user" and provides different security levels.

3. ❌ Error Handling
Preventing the program from continuing when invalid inputs are given (e.g., unknown coffee type, negative numbers).

4. 💰 Price & Discount Calculations
Performing correct math for pricing, applying discounts for specific age groups, and formatting the totals (e.g., $2.50).

5. 👥 Splitting the Bill with Tip
Asking how many people are paying and what tip percentage to use, then calculating the final amount per person.

6. 🔗 Connecting HTML and JavaScript
Making sure the "Start Ordering" button actually triggers the JavaScript logic through onclick="startApp()".

7. 🎨 UI Styling with Background Image
Using CSS to display a stylish background image without affecting text visibility, using brightness filter and centered layout.

8. 🧠 Combining Multiple Steps
Putting login, ordering, and payment into a single, organized flow while keeping the code readable and functional.
